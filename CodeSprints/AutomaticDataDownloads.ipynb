    "Satellite images and outputs from global earth systems models can be very large files. If we're dealing with time series, large spatial areas, or multivariate model outputs, we can quickly be moving into data volumes that exceed the memory and storage capacity of personal computers. To access these types of global data, we are interfacing with online databases. Today's lesson is intended to give you the tools to programmatically access online databases. These tools will enable you to use your personal computer to convert these large datasets into analysis-ready data for your research project. Specifically, today we'll learn to:\n",

    "## G is for *Generalizable*\n",
    "When we're making measurements of an earth system process, we often care deeply about how well uur experimental results apply to other times/places. Since it is often too expensive or two difficult to collect in-situ samples of our earth systems process at all the times and locations that matter, environmental data science allows us to use statistical models to leverage globally available observations to improve the generalizability of our system. These models will generalize our inferences about our earth systems process in one of three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Prediction*: can our model allow us to generalize our observations to out-of-sample times and locations? For example: will my model linking air temperature to green-up time from my experimental forest accurately apply to a forest 200 miles away?\n",
    "2. *Interpolation*: can our model allow us to \"fill in the gaps\" in our spatial/temporal sampling schele? For example: do my measurements of precipitation for my two precipitation gage locations accurately represent the total precipitation that fell in my watershed?\n",
    "3. *Diagnosis*: can our model help us to interpret what processes are either drivers of or covariates with our earth systems process, allowing us to improve our physical understanding of trends and variability in that system: for example: is air temperature or precipitation a more important driver of current cropping system productivity, and how might this impact cropping system function under climate change?\n",
